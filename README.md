In this beautiful responsive and animation based web application users can create and sign in to their accounts. Can filter a add prefered foods catgories based. Users can edit their cart or remove items from their cart.

I have used google `react`, `context api`, `react-router-dom`, `firebase`[for auth], `localstorage`, `bootstrap` and custom `css`.
